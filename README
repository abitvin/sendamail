SENDAMAIL PHP CLASS



About
-----
SendAMail is an easy to use yet powerful send e-mail class for PHP. I created
this class for a number of reasons. The mail() function was not enough; I was
tired creating a custom mail function per project; The mail classes/library's
I found on the internet where to bloated or to feature rich; I like coding and
want to know what's under the hood :)

Some note is that I wanted some sort of a proxy mailer. This is the only
'extra' feature this class have above the standard functions you expect to have
from a e-mail sender. If you send a newsletter it could be a pain in the arse.
I've stumbled on the thing that Yahoo doesn't like my e-mail, sending from a
webserver I used. But from a other webserver it just works great! So I needed
to create something that creates a mail on server X en sends it from server Y.
So the sendProxy() en proxy() functions where born! 



Features
--------

	- plain text/html mail combined
	- multiple to's, cc's, bcc's
	- bounce mail
	- attach files, like pdf's or zip files
	- embed files, like images for newsletters
	- proxy mailer



Documentation
-------------
The code is pretty self explonational.
Just look in the examples directory.
These are the list with functions you can use.

	- attach( $_FILES[] or $file )	// attach a file
	- bcc( <string> )		// add a blind carbon copy
	- bounce( <string> )		// bounce mail
	- cc( <string> )		// add a carbon copy
	- embed( $_FILES[] or $file )	// embed a file into the e-mail
	- eol( <string> )		// change the EOL, default "\n"
	- from( <string> )		// senders e-mail address
	- html( <string> )		// html for the body
	- proxy()			// for the e-mail proxy reciever
	- send()			// sends the e-mail
	- sendProxy()			// sends the e-mail trough the proxy
	- subject( <string> )		// subject of the e-mail
	- text( <string )		// plain text for the body
	- to( <string> )		// add a recipient
	
Important note: Every execution of a to(), bcc() or cc() will add it to the
list. But there's no reset/clear function to empty the lists. You need to
create a new SendAMail class. 

Important note: Don't think you can just sending thousands of mail at once!
This is not my fault. Your webserver is! Most webservers do have a limit of
to's, cc's or bcc's. A limit of 50 per time would be good.
